# Multi-Company Appointment System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a multi-company system for the plumber appointment application while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Data Structure Updates
- **State Structure**: Changed from single schedule to company-based schedules
  - `state.schedule` now organized as `companyId -> dateKey -> slots[]`
  - Added `state.selectedCompanyId` to track current company in admin view
  - Updated storage key to `plumberDemoState_v4` for data migration

- **Company Configuration**: Added `COMPANIES` array with:
  ```javascript
  const COMPANIES = [
      { id: 'C1', name: 'Quick Fix Plumbing', color: '#22c55e' },
      { id: 'C2', name: 'Professional Drain Services', color: '#3b82f6' },
      { id: 'C3', name: 'Emergency Plumbing 24/7', color: '#f59e0b' }
  ];
  ```

### 2. Admin Interface Enhancements
- **Company Selector**: Added dropdown in admin panel to select which company's calendar to view/manage
- **Calendar View**: Now shows selected company's appointments and availability
- **Appointment Creation**: Admin can create appointments for the selected company
- **Request Management**: Admin can assign client requests to any available company

### 3. Client Booking Updates
- **Cross-Company Availability**: Clients see combined free slots from ALL companies
- **No Company Selection**: Clients don't choose companies - they just see available times
- **Request Submission**: Client requests include list of companies that have the requested slot available

### 4. Request Processing Flow
- **Initial Hold**: When client submits request, system temporarily holds slot in one available company
- **Admin Assignment**: Admin reviews request and can choose which company to assign it to
- **Company Options**: Admin sees list of available companies for each time slot
- **Final Assignment**: Once admin approves, appointment is created for chosen company

### 5. Core Function Updates

#### Schedule Management
- `ensureDay(dateKey, companyId)` - Initialize day slots for specific company
- `getCombinedSlots(dateKey)` - Get availability across all companies for client view
- Updated all calendar rendering to use company-specific schedules

#### Appointment Functions
- `createTempAppointment()` - Now includes company assignment
- `createFinalAppointment()` - Creates appointment for specific company
- `confirmAppointment()` / `rejectAppointment()` - Updated for company-based slots

#### Client Functions
- `getFreeWindows()` - Returns available slots from any company
- `sendClientRequest()` - Identifies available companies and holds slot temporarily

### 6. UI/UX Improvements
- **Company Information**: Appointment popups now show company details
- **Request Cards**: Admin sees which companies are available for each request
- **Email Templates**: Updated to include company information in client communications
- **Visual Indicators**: Calendar dots still work for each company's schedule
